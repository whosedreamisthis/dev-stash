# Current Feature: Homepage Nav on Auth Pages

<!-- Feature name and short description -->

Show the homepage top nav bar (`HomeNav`) on the `/sign-in` and `/register` pages, so visitors can get back to the homepage and its sections from there.

In Progress

## Goals

<!-- Goals and requirements -->

- `/sign-in` and `/register` render the same top nav as the homepage: logo linking to `/`, Features and Pricing links, Sign In and Get Started buttons, and the `HomeMobileMenu` on mobile
- The Features and Pricing links work from the auth pages by pointing at the homepage sections (`/#features`, `/#pricing`) instead of same-page anchors
- The fixed nav doesn't cover the auth card: the card stays vertically centered in the space below the nav at 375, 768 and 1280px
- The homepage nav and its behavior (scroll state, anchor links, signed-in "Go to Dashboard") are unchanged
- `/forgot-password` and `/reset-password` stay as they are

## Notes

<!-- Any extra notes -->

- `HomeNav` (`src/components/homepage/HomeNav.tsx`) is a server component taking `isSignedIn`; it wraps the client `NavShell`, which is fixed at the top and turns opaque after 20px of scroll. The mobile menu is `HomeMobileMenu`.
- The section links come from `SECTION_LINKS` in `src/lib/homepage-content.ts` (`#features`, `#pricing`), also used by the footer's Product column; they need a way to resolve to `/#...` off the homepage.
- The auth pages live in `src/app/(auth)/` with no shared layout; each renders `AuthCard` (`src/components/auth/AuthCard.tsx`), whose `<main>` is `min-h-screen` and centered. Both pages redirect signed-in users to `/dashboard`, so the nav there always shows the signed-out buttons.
- Decided (defaults, no answer given): the nav hides the button for the current page (Sign In on `/sign-in`, Get Started on `/register`), and `AuthCard` drops its own logo mark on these two pages since the nav shows the logo.
