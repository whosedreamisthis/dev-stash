- **Initial setup:** Next.js 16 app created with Create Next App (React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, ESLint). Boilerplate removed and landing page reduced to a placeholder heading.
- **Dashboard UI Phase 1:** Initialized shadcn/ui (Button, Input) and made dark mode the default. Added the `/dashboard` route with a layout shell: a placeholder sidebar, a top bar with display-only search, New Collection and New Item buttons, and a placeholder main area.
- **Dashboard UI Phase 2:** Built the dashboard sidebar from mock data: item types with icons, colors and counts linking to `/items/[type]`, favorite and recent collections, folding Types and Collections sections, and a user avatar area with a settings link. A top bar toggle collapses the sidebar on desktop and opens it as a shadcn Sheet drawer on mobile. Added the shadcn Sheet and Avatar components.
